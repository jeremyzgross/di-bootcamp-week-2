//difference between a class componenet and function component

//different way of calling props and different syntax of writting fucntion vs class

//state is how you can RENDER a change on the page (not change data)
//setState()
//this.setState will call it like this.method

//componentDidMount - can be used to set initialized state
//when a user on load you get something

// function componenet
//useState hook (function component version of state and useState)
//useEffect (function component version of componentDidMount)

//componentUnmount is a bollean of weather to render ceterain data. unmount would take out the data on render
