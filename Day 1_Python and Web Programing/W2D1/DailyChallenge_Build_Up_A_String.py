# ^this one was a steep inclind from what we learned today. But after research I understand what it is doing. 
# It loops though each character. i becomes the first character and prints then the loop tells it to print i plus the next one until the length of the world is looped through.
# [:1] is related to slicing in python which i do not fully understand.
